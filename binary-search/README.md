## Problems and Patterns

### Type 1 - Some ad-hoc binary search problems

- [x] ~~[704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)~~ `easy`
- [x] ~~[Order-Agnostic Binary Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/order-agnostic-binary-search/)~~ `easy`
- [x] ~~[35. Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)~~ `easy`
- [x] ~~[74. Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)~~ `medium`
- [ ] [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/) `easy`
- [ ] [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/) `medium` `*****`
- [x] ~~[1099. Two Sum Less Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-less-than-k/)~~ `easy`
- [ ] [4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) `hard`
- [ ] [Count numbers with difference between number and its digit sum greater than specific value](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-numbers-difference-number-digit-sum-greater-specific-value/) `google`

### Type 2 - Understanding lower bound & upper bound

Implement `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` functions first

- [ ] [275. H-Index II](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/) `medium`

### Type 3 - Find the Pivot, then search `*****`

N.B - Whenever there is a rotated or a mountain array and we need to search in that array. First find the inflection point i.e the peak element in case of mountain array or min element or pivot in case of rotated array. This makes our search much easier though we have to do two binary searches.

  - Also similar to finding the pivot point where the array was rotated

### Type 5 - Minimizing the Maximum or maximizing the minimum `*****`

Doesn’t directly look like a binary search problem
